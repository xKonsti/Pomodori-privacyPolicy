# Pomodori FAQ

Here are some common questions about the Pomodoro technique and how to use our Pomodoro app:

The Pomodoro technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It involves breaking work into 25-minute intervals, called "Pomodoros," separated by short breaks. The technique is designed to improve focus, productivity, and reduce burnout.

## How do I use the Pomodoro app?

The standard Pomodoro technique recommends 25-minute Pomodoros and 5-minute breaks, but you can customize the length of your Pomodoros and breaks in our app to best suit your needs.

## Can I customize the app settings?

Yes, you can customize the length of your Pomodoros and breaks, as well as adjust the volume of the timer sound, and select different alarm sounds to notify you when your Pomodoro or break is over.

## How does the Pomodoro technique help with productivity?

The Pomodoro technique helps improve productivity by breaking work into manageable intervals, which helps improve focus and reduce distractions. It also allows for regular breaks, which can help prevent burnout and increase creativity.

## Is the Pomodoro technique suitable for everyone?
